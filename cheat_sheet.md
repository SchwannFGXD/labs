# Primary terminal commands

## ls

- This command displays a list of the current **visible** files in the current directory. The reason I say visible is because some files are hidden but we can display them as well if we instead use the command **ls -a**.

- Another trick with the ls command is using **ls -l** which displays the files in great detail. It shows their permissions, date made and other information. 

- The final thing we learnt about ls today is that you can combine the 2 tricks mentioned above to make **ls -al**. This as suggested will display all files with great detail.

## pwd

pwd simply stands for print working directory and as it says, it displays the route to the current directory.

## cd

This command stands for change directory. It is normally used in combination with a directory route relative to the current directory to change to that new directory.

For instance the following pictures will display an example:
![ls picture](ls.png)
This shows the current directory.
![cd picture](cd.png)
This shows how cd Documents changed the current directory to the Documents one.

There is also another way of using cd. If you use cd by itself then it will simply change the directory to the home directory.
